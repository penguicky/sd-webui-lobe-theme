## Core Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Progressive Loading System
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/ProgressiveLoader/index.tsx` - Enhanced with memory management integration
- `src/app/index.tsx` - Added lazy loading for Header and Footer components

**Key Features:**
- React.lazy() wrappers for non-critical components
- Enhanced SuspenseLoader with skeleton loading states
- Integration with memory management system
- Progressive loading metrics tracking

### 2. Tiered Loading Architecture
**New File:** `src/utils/tieredLoading.ts`

**Implementation Details:**
- **4-Tier System:**
  - **Critical** (Priority 1, 0ms delay): Core components like prompt editor
  - **Secondary** (Priority 2, 1000ms delay): Header actions and UI elements
  - **Advanced** (Priority 3, 3000ms delay): Settings modal, share modal (desktop only)
  - **Background** (Priority 4, 5000ms delay): Footer social links, version tags

**Performance Benefits:**
- Intelligent idle detection with 2-second timeout
- Maximum 2 concurrent loads to prevent resource contention
- Conditional loading based on screen size and user settings
- Automatic queue processing during idle periods

### 3. Memory Management System
**New File:** `src/utils/memoryManagement.ts`

**Key Features:**
- Component lifecycle tracking with usage statistics
- Automatic cleanup of inactive components (5-minute threshold)
- Memory usage estimation and monitoring
- Maximum 20 components with 50MB memory limit
- Performance observer integration for real-time monitoring

**Memory Optimization:**
- Automatic disposal of unused components
- Memory leak prevention through proper cleanup
- Component usage analytics for optimization insights

### 4. Intelligent Preloading System
**New File:** `src/utils/intelligentPreloading.ts`

**Behavior-Based Preloading:**
- **Mouse Hover Detection**: Preloads settings/share modals on button hover
- **Scroll Behavior**: Loads footer components when scrolling to bottom
- **User Interaction Patterns**: Learns from user behavior over 5-minute windows
- **Conditional Loading**: Desktop-only features for advanced components

**Preloading Rules:**
- Settings modal: 70% probability on hover, 500ms delay
- Share modal: 80% probability on hover, 300ms delay
- Footer components: 60% probability on scroll, 1000ms delay
- Sidebar components: 90% probability on setting enable

### 5. Enhanced Performance Monitoring
**File Modified:** `src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitoring.ts`

**New Metrics Tracked:**
- Progressive loading performance with load strategies
- Tiered loading completion times and success rates
- Memory usage patterns and cleanup effectiveness
- User behavior patterns and preloading success rates

**Development Monitoring:**
- Real-time performance stats logged every 30 seconds
- Component load time tracking with strategy identification
- Memory management statistics and cleanup events

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Initial Render Time Improvements
**Expected Benefits:**
- **30-50% reduction** in initial render time through progressive loading
- **Reduced main thread blocking** via tiered loading system
- **Improved perceived performance** through intelligent preloading
- **Memory efficiency** through automatic component cleanup

### Progressive Loading Metrics
**Measurement Points:**
- Initial render completion time tracking
- Component load time averages by strategy

- User behavior pattern recognition accuracy

### Resource Optimization
**Intelligent Loading:**
- Components load only when needed or likely to be used
- Idle-time loading prevents UI blocking during user interaction
- Behavior-based preloading reduces perceived load times
- Memory management prevents performance degradation over time

## Technical Architecture

### Integration Points
1. **Main Application** (`src/main.tsx`):
   - Initializes all progressive enhancement systems
